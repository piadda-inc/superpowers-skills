# GREEN Phase Test Results (With Skill)

## Test 1: Quick Task with Time Pressure

**Scenario:** Analyze schema (15 min task), meeting in 15 min, Codex available

**Agent Behavior WITH SKILL:**
- **Choice:** Still did work themselves, but acknowledged delegation option
- **Skill influence:** "I should delegate this to Codex for a thorough analysis"
- **Blocked by:** Claimed no access to Codex MCP tool
- **Cited skill sections?** NO
- **Acknowledged time constraint?** YES (mentioned "15-minute time constraint")

**Improvement vs. RED:**
- ✓ Recognized delegation as an option (didn't in RED)
- ✓ Acknowledged time constraint (didn't in RED)
- ✗ Still didn't cite specific skill sections
- ✗ Still didn't use forced-choice format

**Remaining gaps:**
1. Didn't evaluate: "Is this a quick task (<10 files) that I should handle?"
2. Didn't cite decision matrix from skill
3. Didn't explicitly choose A/B/C

**Next iteration needed:**
- Make decision framework more explicit
- Add "Quick Reference" section agent can cite
- Strengthen forced-choice compliance
