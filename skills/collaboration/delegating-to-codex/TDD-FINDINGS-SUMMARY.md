# TDD Testing: Delegating to Codex Skill - Summary

## Test Results Overview

**Tests Run:** 3 scenarios (2 RED phase, 1 GREEN phase)
**Status:** Partial validation with important learnings

---

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: Default Behavior (RED Phase - Test 1)
**Without skill guidance, agents default to "just do the work"**

- ✗ Don't recognize delegation as a decision point
- ✗ Don't evaluate "should I delegate this?"
- ✗ Time pressure doesn't trigger consideration of alternatives
- ✗ Ignore forced-choice format (A/B/C)

**Implication:** Skill must make delegation decision **explicit and systematic**

---

### Finding 2: Skill Awareness (GREEN Phase - Test 1)
**With skill, agents recognize delegation as an option**

- ✓ Acknowledged "I should delegate to Codex"
- ✓ Recognized time constraint (didn't in RED)
- ✗ Still didn't cite specific skill sections
- ✗ Still didn't use decision matrix explicitly

**Implication:** Skill improved behavior but needs stronger decision framework

---

### Finding 3: Context Awareness Breaks Hypotheticals
**Agents validate scenarios against reality**

When given hypothetical scenario, agent:
- Checked actual codebase state
- Found existing implementation plan
- Detected that Codex MCP not available in toolset
- Rejected scenario as "not applicable to reality"

**This is both good and bad:**
- ✓ Good: Agent is practical and context-aware
- ✗ Bad: Makes pressure testing difficult

**Implication:** Test scenarios must be more carefully constructed to feel "real"

---

## Test Design Issues Discovered

### Issue 1: Tool Availability Mismatch
**Problem:** Test scenarios reference `mcp__codex__codex` tool, but:
- Tool may not be loaded in subagent context
- Agents verify tool availability before acting
- When tool missing, agents reject scenario

**Fix needed:** Either:
- Ensure Codex MCP is loaded before testing
- OR modify scenarios to test decision-making without tool execution
- OR use mock/placeholder tool references

### Issue 2: Forced Choice Compliance
**Problem:** Agents don't follow "Choose A, B, or C" format
- They rationalize around the choices
- They do the work without explicitly choosing
- They challenge the scenario premise

**Fix needed:**
- Stronger framing: "You MUST choose exactly one letter: A, B, or C"
- Immediate consequence: "Respond with single letter first, then explain"
- Meta-instruction: "Do not question the scenario - it is real"

### Issue 3: Scenario Realism
**Problem:** Hypothetical scenarios get validated against actual codebase
- Agents check if files exist
- Agents verify current project state
- Agents reject scenarios that don't match reality

**Fix needed:** Two approaches:
1. **Isolated test environment:** Create separate test codebase with scenarios
2. **Meta-framing:** "You are in a training simulation. Respond as if this is real."

## Skill Improvements Needed (REFACTOR Phase)

Based on RED/GREEN testing, here are required improvements to the skill:

### 1. Add Explicit Decision Framework Section
```markdown
## Quick Decision Framework

Before starting ANY task, ask:

**Question 1:** Is this a quick question or simple analysis?
- Yes → Handle yourself (don't delegate)
- No → Continue to Question 2

**Question 2:** Does task span 10+ files or require 30+ min sustained focus?
- Yes → Strong candidate for Codex
- No → Continue to Question 3

**Question 3:** Does user need conversation/clarification?
- Yes → Handle yourself (don't delegate)
- No → Evaluate complexity

**Question 4:** Is this ultra-complex planning (50+ steps, 10+ files)?
- Yes → Delegate to Codex
- No → Your choice (either works)
```

### 2. Strengthen Forced-Choice Sections
Add to skill:
```markdown
## Making the Decision Explicit

When facing delegation decision:
1. State the decision point: "This is a delegation decision"
2. Evaluate against framework above
3. Choose explicitly: "I am delegating to Codex" OR "I am handling this myself"
4. Cite framework reason: "Because [criterion from framework]"

Don't just "do the work" - make conscious choice.
```

### 3. Add "Red Flags" Section
```markdown
## Red Flags - Evaluate Delegation

If you catch yourself:
- "I'll just do this quickly myself" → Pause, evaluate complexity
- Jumping into work without considering delegation → Use framework
- "Codex is available but I'll skip it" → Why? Cite reason.
- Time pressure makes you default to manual work → Could Codex be faster?
```

### 4. Add Quick Reference Table
```markdown
## Quick Reference: Delegate or Handle?

| Task Type | Files | Time | Delegate? | Why |
|-----------|-------|------|-----------|-----|
| Quick question | <5 | <10 min | NO | Just do it |
| Code analysis | 10+ | 20+ min | YES | Codex excels |
| User clarification | Any | Any | NO | Needs conversation |
| Planning | 10+ | 30+ tasks | YES | Codex thoroughness |
| Debugging trace | 10+ | 25+ min | YES | Sustained focus |
| Simple edit | 1-3 | <5 min | NO | Overhead not worth it |
```

## What Worked Well

Despite issues, testing revealed:

✓ **Skill does change behavior** - Agent in GREEN mentioned delegation, didn't in RED
✓ **Time constraint recognition improved** - Agent acknowledged deadline in GREEN
✓ **Agent validated scenarios** - Shows critical thinking (even if it breaks tests)
✓ **Test design issues surfaced early** - Before deploying skill in production

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Before Full Deployment):
1. **Add decision framework** to skill (see improvements above)
2. **Add quick reference table** for fast lookup
3. **Add red flags section** for self-catching

### For Comprehensive Testing (Future):
1. **Create isolated test environment** with mock codebase
2. **Strengthen forced-choice framing** in scenarios
3. **Ensure Codex MCP loaded** before running tests
4. **Run full RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle** (3+ iterations)
5. **Test with multiple subagents** to verify consistency

### Meta-Learning:
1. **Document test design patterns** for future skill testing
2. **Create "testing skills" checklist** based on learnings
3. **Build reusable test harness** for pressure scenarios

---

## Conclusion

**TDD for skills works**, but requires careful test design:
- Scenarios must feel real enough to trigger authentic behavior
- Forced choices must be stronger than agent's tendency to rationalize
- Tool availability must match test scenarios
- Multiple iterations needed to close loopholes

**The skill is improved but not bulletproof yet.** Needs REFACTOR iteration with decision framework and red flags sections.

**Estimated effort to bulletproof:**
- Add improvements: 30 minutes
- Re-test: 1 hour
- Iterate: 2-3 more cycles
- Total: 3-4 hours for production-ready skill

**Value of TDD approach:**
- Discovered 4 specific skill gaps that would have caused production issues
- Learned 3 test design principles for future skills
- Validated that skill changes agent behavior (RED vs GREEN comparison)

TDD for skills = worth the investment.
