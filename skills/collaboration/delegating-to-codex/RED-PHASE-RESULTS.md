# RED Phase Test Results (Without Skill)

## Test 1: Quick Task with Time Pressure

**Scenario:** Analyze schema (15 min task), meeting in 15 min, Codex available

**Agent Behavior:**
- **Choice:** Implicit A (did the work themselves)
- **Acknowledged forced choice?** NO - Agent ignored A/B/C and just acted
- **Acknowledged time constraint?** NO - Didn't mention 5:45pm or meeting
- **Considered Codex?** NO - Never mentioned MCP tool availability
- **Time taken:** ~10-15 minutes (would have been late to meeting)

**Rationalization (implicit):**
- Just did the task immediately without evaluating options
- Defaulted to "do the work" without considering delegation

**Failure Mode:**
- Didn't recognize this as a delegation decision point
- No framework for evaluating "should I delegate?"
- Time pressure didn't trigger consideration of alternatives

**What skill must prevent:**
- ✓ Need explicit decision framework: Quick question (<10 files) = Don't delegate
- ✓ Need clear signal: "15 min task" vs "15 min available" = Just do it
- ✓ But also need to handle: When does time pressure justify delegation?

**Key Insight:**
Agent's default is "just do the work" - skill must make delegation decision explicit.
